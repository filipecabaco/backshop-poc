# Backshop

Simple website that collects Backshop Lessons so they are easilly acessible!

Check it out! http://backshop-poc.herokuapp.com/

## Structure

So... currently the structure is a bit on the confusion side but the important bit it's in `./src/sections`. Here you will find a file for each entry with a simple constant string that will be used in the `./src/sections/sections.tsx` file to create the proper component.

The content should be written in Markdown and be careful to properly escape the ``` character in code blocks.

Syntax highlighting is provided by [markdown-it](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it) and [highligh.js](https://github.com/isagalaev/highlight.js/) so you can check there for more information regarding this.
